🚀 A Breakthrough for Ukrainian NLP: Emotion Recognition in Text 🇺🇦

Today, I’m thrilled to share a project that marks a real breakthrough — the first Ukrainian-focused system for recognizing emotional tone in text.
After extensive research, I found no existing solution tailored specifically for the Ukrainian language. So… I decided to build one myself. 💡

💬 What it does

The model detects emotional sentiment — whether a text expresses joy, sadness, anger, or neutrality — and does so entirely in Ukrainian.
It’s built on XLM-RoBERTa, trained and fine-tuned on carefully prepared Ukrainian datasets, and designed for easy integration through an API or open package.

🧠 Why it matters

Language is more than words — it carries feeling, culture, and identity.
By creating emotion recognition for Ukrainian, we’re empowering tools that can truly understand our digital communication:

AI chatbots that empathize.

Analytics that capture genuine customer sentiment.

Educational and mental health tools that listen — not just read.

⚙️ Behind the scenes

The project includes:

Data collection & preprocessing of real Ukrainian text

Stratified training with balanced emotional labels

Fine-tuning and model evaluation

Deployment pipeline for API use and monitoring

🌍 Why I’m proud

This is more than a model — it’s a step toward stronger representation of the Ukrainian language in global AI.
We deserve tools that understand our emotions natively — not through translation.

If you’re passionate about AI, NLP, or Ukrainian tech innovation, I’d love to connect and collaborate!
